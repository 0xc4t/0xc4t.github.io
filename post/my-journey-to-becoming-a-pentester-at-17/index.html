<p>Hello World!
My name is <strong>Varel Valensio</strong>, but you can call me <strong>Varel</strong>—or anything you like, as long as it's respectful lol.</p>
<p>In this article, I want to share my journey into pentesting. Hopefully my story can help or inspire those of you who want to get into cybersecurity.</p>
<h2><strong>A Bit About My Background</strong></h2>
<p>I'm from <strong>East Belitung</strong>, Bangka Belitung, Indonesia. I graduated from elementary school but couldn't continue due to family and financial issues. I finished elementary school around 2019 when I was about 12.</p>
<p>But honestly, my interest in "hacking" appeared even earlier—around age 10–11. Especially after watching the movie <em>Who Am I</em>. I was like, “damn, this is cool.”</p>
<p>I'm sharing this because it’s part of how I eventually became a <strong>pentester at 17</strong>, right after I finally got my ID card lol.</p>
<h2><strong>Where It All Started: Networking</strong></h2>
<p>I was deeply interested in <strong>computer networks</strong>. I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP Address</li>
<li>MAC Address</li>
<li>OSI Layer</li>
<li>TCP/IP</li>
<li>Network Services</li>
<li>Mikrotik</li>
</ul>
<p>And yes… I avoided Winbox just to look “pro,” even though it made my life harder hahaha.</p>
<p>After learning networking, I suddenly wanted to be a <strong>front-end developer</strong>. Sounds funny, right? Instead of going into SOC, NOC, DevSecOps, or SysAdmin, I wanted to build websites haha.</p>
<p>I studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap from the WPU channel. Thanks a lot, Mas Sandhika Galih!</p>
<h2><strong>Getting Serious About Pentesting</strong></h2>
<p>Once I understood basic web programming and networking, that childhood hacker spirit came back. I started playing CTFs on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Root-Me</li>
<li>TryHackMe</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I joined Telegram communities, took Udemy courses, and started hunting vulnerabilities on government websites under CSIRT programs. Sometimes I got certificates, sometimes swag, and rarely money hahaha.</p>
<p>I also shared most of my certificates on <strong>LinkedIn</strong>, as part of my portfolio.
Then one day, an HR from <strong>Xynexis International</strong>, named Anggi, messaged me. I honestly doubted they would hire someone who didn’t finish school.</p>
<p>But I chose to be honest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I only graduated from elementary school and I’m currently trying to get my junior high diploma. If the company is okay with that, then I’m ready to work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surprisingly, she checked with her manager. About a month later, I was given a HackTheBox lab (an insane machine… unbelievable lol). I did my best using whatever knowledge I had.</p>
<p>Then I got invited to a technical interview, answered based on experience… and I got accepted.</p>
<p>When I turned 17, I flew to Jakarta and started working. On the first day I was super stiff and awkward.
Fun fact: I <strong>bowed and shook hands politely</strong> with HR when going home.
Yes… I literally <em>salim</em>-ed hahaha.</p>
<h2><strong>The Importance of Community &amp; Friends</strong></h2>
<p>One thing I also learned along the way is this:</p>
<p><strong>Community and friendships are extremely important.</strong></p>
<p>Being around people who share the same passion helps a lot.
Through communities, I met friends who were willing to discuss, share knowledge, exchange ideas, and grow together.</p>
<p>Sometimes one simple discussion can open the door to a whole new understanding.
Sometimes friends give you motivation when you're stuck or doubting yourself.
And sometimes they’re just there to remind you that learning doesn’t have to be lonely.</p>
<p>So yeah—build connections, join communities, and make friends.
You don’t have to walk this journey alone.</p>
<h2><strong>What’s the Lesson Here?</strong></h2>
<p>From everything I’ve gone through, I realized something:</p>
<p><strong>Your background doesn’t define your future.
Your effort, consistency, and willingness to learn do.</strong></p>
<p>If you want to be a pentester:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn <strong>networking</strong></li>
<li>Learn <strong>operating systems</strong></li>
<li>Learn <strong>basic programming</strong></li>
<li>Join <strong>communities</strong></li>
<li>Build <strong>friendships</strong></li>
<li>Explore <strong>cybersecurity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>With the right foundation and people around you, your path becomes much easier, more fun, and way more meaningful.</p>
<p>I hope my story gives you some motivation or a clearer picture of this journey.
Good luck wherever you're heading next!</p>
