## My GitHub Pages site — a place where I drop random thoughts, experiments, and write-ups whenever inspiration hits.

#### Here -> https://0xc4t.re

I mainly write about:
- Web Application Pentesting – findings, techniques, breakdowns, and experiments
- Active Directory Pentesting – attack paths, labs, and real-case notes
- Malware Development (MalDev) – learning notes, theory, and small experiments
- Book Summaries & Insights – notes from books I read, whether technical or non-technical
- Certification Journeys – study notes, exam experience, and preparation tips
- Daily Stuff – only when I’m in the mood

This site isn’t meant to be perfect — just a space for learning, thinking, and documenting the journey.
Feel free to explore, fork, or reach out if something catches your attention.
